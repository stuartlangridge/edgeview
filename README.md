A way to view a screenshot of your Ubuntu Touch app on an image of the Ubuntu Edge. Distorts the screenshot appropriately so that it appears to be on the screen. Designed not for shots looking directly vertically at a phone screen, but for "action" shots where someone's holding the phone in their hand. Entirely client-side: no server processing involved.

Thank you to Rich Wareham (@rjw57) for help with the vector maths :-)
